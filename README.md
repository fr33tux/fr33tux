👋 Hi, I’m Jérôme.B!


I mainly code using Python 💙 (and currently learning Rust), [Codium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis) are my go-to development tools.

I’m particularly fond of 🚴, ⛵, ⛰️, 🥾 - I spend most of my time outside 🌅

🧑‍💼 I'm a Principal Security Engineer [@Malwarebytes](https://github.com/malwarebytes), with a special focus on Application Security and Privacy. I'm also the Technical Project Manager for AdwCleaner.
